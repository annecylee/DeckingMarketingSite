# A New Deck for a New Home: Our Customer's Journey to Quality

Ever wonder how far people will go for quality? Today, we had a customer who drove his pickup miles to our warehouse, to pick up 1,000 square feet of our premium grey fiberglass composite decking.

## Out with the Old, In with the New

Our customers recently purchased a spacious house with a deck that needed some TLC. The existing cedar deck had seen better days, showing signs of cracking and rot. It was time for an upgrade, and they knew exactly what they wanted.

## Why Boltix?

So, why did they choose our decking? Here's what sealed the deal:

1. Prime Quality: Our decking stands out in durability and aesthetics.
2. Long-Lasting: Built to withstand the test of time.
3. Maintenance-Free: Say goodbye to annual staining and sealing!
4. Weather-Resistant: Come rain or shine, our decking holds strong.

## The Journey to Better Decking

It's not every day that customers drive long distances for building materials. But for a deck that will last for years and enhance their new home? That's a journey worth taking.

We're excited to see the transformation of their space and proud to be part of their home improvement story. Stay tuned for before-and-after photos!
